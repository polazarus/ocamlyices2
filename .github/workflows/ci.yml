#
# This Travis-ci configuration file has been writen to automate the
# building process and make deploying the application easy. for the
# platforms Linux and Mac OS X.
#
# The travis-ci servers are going to run this script on any push to the
# repo. Basically, it
# - tells the author of a commit if his commit has broken the build,
# - deploys two .zip containing the linux and osx apps, with the touist
#   compiled in it
#
# To allow Travis-ci to know that something has been pushed to the repo the
# owner of the project (Olivier Lezaud back then) had had to link the repo
# to the Travis-ci website.
#
# Secrets:
# - GH_TOKEN is a PAT that must have the public_repo scope and be in the
#   touist org.
